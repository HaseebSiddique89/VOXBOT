# VOXBOT
 This project is a Flask-based chatbot using AIML, Neo4j, and AI techniques like spell checking, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. It stores user interactions, builds relationships between entities, and responds to queries. The bot fetches info from Wikipedia, provides word synonyms, and uses logic-based reasoning for answers.
